Purpose of Script:
   Applies Annotations gathered by the GatherHostInfo Script back to the vCenter
  
   Prompted inputs:               vCenterName, VMHostName
   Uses files which where generated by
   "GatherHostInfo.ps1":    $USERPROFILE$\Documents\HostUpgradeInfo\$VMHost\Annotations\VMAnnotations-<HostName>.csv
                            $USERPROFILE$\Documents\HostUpgradeInfo\$VMHost\Annotations\VMHost-<HostName>.csv

Prerequisites:

    #1  This script uses the VMware modules installed by the installation of VMware PowerCLI
        ENSURE that VMware PowerCLI has been installed.  
    
        Installation media can be found here: 
        https://my.vmware.com 

    #2  To complete necessary tasks this script will require Administrator account priviledges
        you will be prompted for this account and password.  The Get-Credential method
        is used for this, so credentials are maintained securely.
===================================================================================================================
Usage:

Simply run the script, you will be prompted for Credentials, and then the vCenter and Host that you want to work with.

This script expects that "GatherHostInfo.ps1" has been run previously, and that the Annotation files produced by that script are still present under $USERPROFILE$\Documents\HostUpgradeInfo\$VMHost\Annotations
